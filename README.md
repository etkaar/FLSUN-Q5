# Notes

- The power supply of the FLSUN Q5 has an unused 24V terminal. You can use that.
- You can use JST connectors to allow (un)plugging the illumination plate.
- An LED always needs a resistor to limit the current: Seperate resistors for each LED in parallel *or* one resistor if multiple LEDs are wired in series. For this holder we only need one resistor, because the three LEDs are wired in series. Altough resistors might be sometimes referred to as 'pre-resistor', a resistor can be placed before, after or even between. That makes absolutely no difference.
